# Real-Time-Face-Recognition (OpenCV)

I used two projects to do this project

. Project #1 is https://github.com/medsriha/Real-Time-Face-Recognition 
  </br>  This project for take photo and training
  
. Project #2 is https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Real-Time-Face-Recognition
  </br>  This project for recognition, because the first project has issue in recognition.
  
## Steps:

1- `cmd: python face_taker.py`

2- `cmd: python face_train.py`

3- `cmd: python main.py`

Requirements:
  
- `conda update conda`
- `conda update anaconda`
- `conda create -n env_dlib python=3.6`
